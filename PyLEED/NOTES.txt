To get the library code to be callable (stuff in TLEED/v1.2/lib)
  should be trivial. f2py -c -m <libname> <libfile> should do
  the trick. But, there are nontrivial calculations done in the
  main programs (stuff in TLEED/v1.2/src).

Idea 1: Wrap the programs in TLEED/v1.2/src in functions/subroutines,
         call f2py on that. This is extra painful because the functions
         being called often read from stdin, which is not something I'll
         be able to easily emulate in python. I'd have to edit the Fortran
         code to read from files instead, which will modify lots of stuff.
         Seems awful to do.
