C  Subroutine muftin contains explicit energy dependence of inner 
C  potentials. The functional form should be left to the user entirely,
C  thus the subroutine is included in the input explicitly.

C  All quantities should be set in eV. Conversion to Hartree (atomic units)
C  is handled by ref-calc.f itself. Both the real and imaginary part should
C  be given as positive values (the program then handles the sign correctly).

      subroutine muftin(EEV,VO,VV,VPI,VPIS,VPIO)

C  global variable

C  EEV :  electron energy in the vacuum region
C  VO  :  difference between real part of inner potential in the bulk and in
C         topmost layer. Usually irrelevant -> set to zero.
C  VV  :  real part of the inner potential in the bulk.
C  VPI :  imaginary part of the inner potential.
C  VPIS:  in case different values for the imaginary part of the inner
C  VPIO:  potential for bulk and topmost layer were desired, VPIS would
C         correspond to the bulk value, VPIO would be the respective
C         value for the topmost layer. Usually, the effect is irrelevant,
C         i.e. both are set equal to VPI.

      real EEV,VO,VV,VPI,VPIS,VPIO

C  local variable

C  workfn: Work function of the LEED filament material. Theoretical predictions for the
C          inner potential usually have their energy zero fixed at the
C          Fermi level; the experimental energy scale (-> EEV) nominally
C          does the same, except for the fact that electrons need to overcome
C          the work function of the cathode first. Note that the this value is
C          thus formally determined by a LEED fit, yet don't trust its accuracy.

      real workfn

C  set work function of cathode
C  work function should be positive (added to exp. energy EEV)

      workfn = 0.

C  set real part of inner potential

c      here: Rundgren type inner potential for FeAl

      VV = workfn - max( (0.39-76.63/sqrt(EEV+workfn+9.68)) , -10.30)

c  set difference between bulk and overlayer inner potential

      VO = 0.

c  set imaginary part of inner potential - energy independent value used here

      VPI = 5.0

c  set substrate / overlayer imaginary part of inner potential

      VPIS = VPI
      VPIO = VPI

      return
      end
