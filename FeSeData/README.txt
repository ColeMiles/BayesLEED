When running preparedata.py, the source directory must only contain the .csv's
 you want to collate into a single file, and every filename must follow the pattern
    [name]<x><y>.csv

Where [name] can be anything, but <x> and <y> are both single digits specifying
    the reciprocal space indices of the beam.
